# Ollo, I’m Mushin (@XSiya)

Founder • Builder • Engineer

I’m a **technical founder** focused on building scalable digital products and AI-driven platforms. My work sits at the intersection of **software engineering, product strategy, and automation**, with a strong bias toward shipping real things that create leverage. My journey started with writing code; now I build the teams, systems, and vision behind the code.

I don’t just write code — I design systems, validate ideas, and turn concepts into products people actually use.

## What I’m Working On

- Building and scaling **founder-led products** with a strong focus on:
  - High-converting landing pages
  - Distribution-first product thinking
  - Automation and intelligent systems
- Developing **AI-assisted platforms** that reduce operational friction and accelerate execution
- Architecting **mobile, web, and backend systems** that are production-grade from day one

---

## Core Focus Areas

- **Product & Startup Engineering**
  - MVP → PMF → Scale
  - Rapid iteration, feedback loops, analytics-driven decisions

- **Mobile & Web Platforms**
  - Flutter, Angular, modern frontend stacks
  - Performance, UX, and maintainability

- **Cloud & Infrastructure**
  - AWS, Azure, GCP
  - Serverless, containers, CI/CD

- **AI & Automation**
  - Intelligent agents
  - Workflow automation
  - Applied machine learning (practical > theoretical)

- **Systems Thinking**
  - Clean architecture
  - Long-term maintainability
  - Business-aligned technical decisions

---

## Collaboration

I collaborate selectively.

I’m interested in:
- Founders and operators building **real businesses**
- Engineers who think in **systems, not just features**
- Products that create **leverage, efficiency, or access**

If the project doesn’t solve a meaningful problem or move the needle, I’m probably not the right fit.
